# tiatus

Tiatus is a multiple point timing system. 


It is derived from the timing system used for the Galway Head of the River timing system but is being opened up and made more flexible. 


The Galway Head of the River timing system in its final incarnation had its frontend written in AngularJS and ES5 (angular 1.x) but in tiatus this is being migrated to Angular with Typescript and bundled by webpack.  
This allows for more easily maintained, performant code. This migration is currently taking place and as such the system is a work in progress which may not be suitable for usage at this point.  
The backend is Java sitting on a JEE server.
  
The initial migration is nearing completion. This is more a proof of concept stage to get familiar with the new Angular framework and as such will have an initial reduced feature set. 
See the [TODO](TODO.md) for features to be implemented.  

See [developer notes](DEVELOPER_NOTES.md) for implementation details.
